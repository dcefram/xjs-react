# XJS React

An unofficial/3rd-party collection of XSplit themed React UI components primarily used to create XSplit Broadcaster plugins 
that align with the current XSplit Broadcaster UX.

## Why bother?

This 3rd party, **unofficial**, UI Library was conceived due to the lack of "zero friction" react libraries within the XSplit team.
The React UI libraries that I tried to use required me to **eject** a create-react-app project, which I do not want, 
and another required me to use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) even though I do not plan on using styled-components. Why.

The only, almost unobtrusive, XSplit UI library that used to work was XUI, which makes use of [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/)...
Albeit, based off of a very ancient Polymer version.

This is my attempt to just create a component library that I would use while working on XSplit Plugins as a consultant.

## Objectives

- Should be able to use this library out of the box without any additional configuration or libraries to install
- Should be themeable (eventually...)
