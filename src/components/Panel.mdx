# Panel

Panels are used to group a set of related elements/content. This is often useful to group a particular set of controls based on their category.

### Best practices

- Group related contents in a panel
- Group a subset of related contents in a child panel

## Properties

<Props of={Panel} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Panel>Click me</Panel>
  <Panel label="With a label">Here goes some content</Panel>
</Playground>

## With different variants

<Playground>
  <Panel style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>Here goes some content</Panel>
  <Panel variant="dark">Here goes some content</Panel>
</Playground>

## Nested Panels

<Playground>
  <Panel label="Nest Panels">
    <Panel variant="dark">Here goes some content</Panel>
  </Panel>
</Playground>
