# Button

Buttons make common actions more obvious and help users more easily perform them.

### Best practices

- Group buttons logically into sets based on usage and importance.
- Ensure that button actions are clear and consistent.
- The main action of a group set can be a primary button.
- Select a single button variation and do not mix them.

## Properties

## Basic usage

  <Button>Click me</Button>

## With different variants
