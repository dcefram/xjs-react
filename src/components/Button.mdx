# Button

Buttons make common actions more obvious and help users more easily perform them.

### Best practices

- Group buttons logically into sets based on usage and importance.
- Ensure that button actions are clear and consistent.
- The main action of a group set can be a primary button.
- Select a single button variation and do not mix them.

## Properties

<Props of={Button} />

## Basic usage
<Playground>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
</Playground>

## With different variants

<ThemeProvider>
  <Playground>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
    <Button primary>Click me</Button>
    <Button disabled>Click me</Button>
    <Button primary disabled>
      Click me
    </Button>
  </Playground>
</ThemeProvider>
