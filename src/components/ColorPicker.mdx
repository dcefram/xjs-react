# ColorPicker

ColorPicker is normally used for controls that would allow users to type in data.

@TODO: I'll improve this lateron to auto-position the pallet container depending on the size of the window.

## Properties

<Props of={ColorPicker} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <ColorPicker />
</Playground>
