# Getting Started

An unofficial/3rd-party collection of XSplit themed React UI components primarily used to create XSplit Broadcaster plugins
that align with the current XSplit Broadcaster UX.

## Why bother?

This 3rd party, **unofficial**, UI Library was conceived due to the lack of "zero friction" react libraries within the XSplit team.
The React UI library that I tried to use required me to **eject** a create-react-app project, which I do not want. Another used Polymer, which had all sorts of trouble when using in a React project.

This is my attempt to just create a component library that I would use while working on XSplit Plugins as a consultant.

All of the UI components here are made out of assumptions, based off of existing official plugins. I do not have an official
style guide to base it all off, but since there are a couple of official plugins already that has similar UI, it's easy to
just mimic their feel by just winging it.

## Installation

```
# with npm
npm i @dcefram/xui-react

# with yarn
yarn add @dcefram/xui-react
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ThemeProvider from '@dcefram/xui-react/components/ThemeProvider';
import Button from '@dcefram/xui-react/components/Button';

export default function() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Button>Hi!</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

Using ThemeProvider would add some global styles which includes setting the font-family to Roboto
as this is the default font used by XSplit Broadcaster's source properties window.

Further details on the [ThemeProvider component is in its own page](/src-components-theme-provider)
