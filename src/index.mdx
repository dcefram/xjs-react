# Getting Started

This 3rd party, **unofficial**, UX Library was primarily started due to the lack of "zero friction" react libraries within the XSplit team.
The React UI libraries that I tried to use required me to **eject** a create-react-app project, which I do not want, 
and another required me to use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) even though I do not plan on using styled-components. Why.

The only, almost unobtrusive, XSplit UI library that used to work was XUI, which makes use of [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/)...
Albeit, based off of a very ancient Polymer version.

## Installation

```
# with npm
npm i @dcefram/xui-react

# with yarn
yarn add @dcefram/xui-react
```
